        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, I'm Akash Yadav Jangala. As I stand here on my 24th journey around the Sun, it's awe-inspiring to realize that Earth has been on its cosmic voyage for 4.54 billion revolutions. To put it precisely, I am just a tiny fraction, about 0.00000000528634361233 times, of the age of our remarkable planet. Welcome to my corner of the web, where I share my experiences, knowledge, thoughts, and cybersecurity tools.

To offer a brief introduction about myself, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Anurag University. Currently, I'm in the final semester of my Master of Science program in Cybersecurity at the University of Tampa. You might wonder why there's been a significant shift in my academic journey, transitioning from my undergraduate field to cybersecurity.

I started my academic journey uncertain about my interests and explored various fields such as Artificial Intelligence, VLSI Physical Design Engineering, Embedded Systems, and programming. It wasn't until my second year when I attended a cybersecurity workshop that everything fell into place.

Early in my undergraduate years, I explored various fields, including Artificial Intelligence, VLSI Physical Design Engineering, Embedded Systems, and programming, seeking to discover my true passion. It was in my second year that I stumbled upon a cybersecurity workshop, and something clicked. I developed a deep passion for this field.

I further honed my skills through two years of work as a Penetration Tester Intern. However, I realized that to truly excel in the industry, I needed more knowledge and expertise. That's when I made the decision to pursue a Master's degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Tampa.

My journey has been one of constant exploration, learning, and adaptation, and I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and knowledge in the field of cybersecurity with you.
